⛔ ERROR

Failed to apply patch file left-pad+1.3.0+002+world.patch.

If this patch file is no longer useful, delete it and run

  patch-package

To partially apply the patch (if possible) and output a log of errors to fix, run

  patch-package --partial

After which you should make any required changes inside node_modules/left-pad, and finally run

  patch-package left-pad

to update the patch file.
